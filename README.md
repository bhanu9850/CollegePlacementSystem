# CollegePlacementSystem


--> College Placement System a web-based application designed to streamline the placement process for students, college admins, and placement officers. The system integrates all aspects of the placement process in one place, from the creation of job drives to student application management, tracking, and communication with recruiters.The system serves as a one-stop solution to handle placement activities.

--> I developed the system using Python and Django, utilizing Django ORM for database querying and Jinja as the template engine. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of Bootstrap for responsiveness, while MySQL is used for managing the data.
